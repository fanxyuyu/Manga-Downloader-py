## About

This is just a simple program made entirely in python that allows the download of manga chapters from [mangakakalot](https://ww5.mangakakalot.tv/). Everything was made with the intention of learning more about python in a fun and interactive way!

**Disclaimer**
I do not own mangakakalot.tv or any of its contents.

## How to start

To get the program to work you should download the source code and follow the next steps:
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Install the requirements
  3. Run the code and enjoy :)


## How to use
  - Insert the name of the manga you wish to download
  - Insert the value that matches the name of the manga on the list
  - Select the chapters to download in one of the following ways
      - 1: Use the number of the chapter (i.e "1.0")
      - 2: Use commas to select multiple chapters (i.e "1.0, 3.0, 15.0")
      - 3: Use dash to select a range of chapters (i.e "1.0 - 15.0)
